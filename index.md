# Intel User Persona & PC System Analysis

## Project Introduction
```
There are 11 different types of personas (user type) in our dataset and we ignore the group of “Unknown”. We tried to explore the different computer setup for these groups. To take a step further in our investigation, we first did some hypothesis testing for these groups based on some numerical features like the ram of PCs. We chose the paired t-test for the testing because we want to check the difference between each pair of groups. In the results (shown in the hypothesis testing notebook), most of our p-values were below the threshold of 0.05, which means there are some significant differences among these groups. The hypothesis testing further proved our guess so we decided to move on to some machine learning models.
After the hypothesis testing, we decide to perform some classification models based on the features we are interested in and the results are shown below.
